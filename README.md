<h1 align="center">#Google Search Clone<h1></h1>

This is my solution for Problem 0 of Harvard University's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. The project involves developing a functional Google clone where executing a search query successfully returns and displays relevant results, emulating the core functionality of the original search engine.


  <h2>How to Test the Code</h2>
    
    1-Download the repository files (usually in a .zip or .rar archive)

    2-Extract the files using WinRAR or any extraction tool

    3-Open the extracted folder

    4-Double-click the index.html file to open it in your web browser

  No installation or server required - it works directly in your browser!
  
  Note: Keep all files in their original folder structure for proper styling.
