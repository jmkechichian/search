#Google Search Clone

This is my solution for Problem 0 of Harvard University's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. The project involves developing a functional Google clone where executing a search query successfully returns and displays relevant results, emulating the core functionality of the original search engine.


How to Test the Code:

Download the repository files (usually in a .zip or .rar archive)

Extract the files using WinRAR or any extraction tool

Open the extracted folder

Double-click the index.html file to open it in your web browser

No installation or server required - it works directly in your browser!
Note: Keep all files in their original folder structure for proper styling.
